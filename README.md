# Decentralized Crop Insurance for Smallholder Farmers

A blockchain-based platform providing affordable, transparent, and automated crop insurance to protect small-scale farmers against climate risks.

## Overview

The Decentralized Crop Insurance for Smallholder Farmers (DCISF) platform leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and weather oracles to deliver parametric crop insurance solutions to previously underserved agricultural communities. By removing intermediaries, automating processes, and using transparent data sources, the system drastically reduces costs while increasing trust and accessibility for small-scale farmers worldwide.

## Core Components

### 1. Farmer Registration Contract

This smart contract records essential details about smallholder farming operations.

**Features:**
- Simplified digital onboarding process
- Geolocation and farm boundary mapping
- Crop type and planting cycle documentation
- Historical yield data collection (when available)
- Farm size and agricultural practice documentation
- Farmer identification and contact information
- Group/cooperative registration options
- Offline registration capability with later synchronization

### 2. Weather Data Oracle Contract

This contract provides verified, tamper-proof climate information from multiple sources.

**Features:**
- Integration with satellite weather data providers
- Connection to ground-based weather stations
- Community-operated weather monitoring nodes
- Historical weather pattern analysis
- Data validation through multiple sources
- Weather event classification and severity measurement
- Regional microclimate mapping
- Transparent data reporting accessible to all participants

### 3. Automated Claim Processing Contract

This contract automatically triggers insurance payouts based on predefined weather events.

**Features:**
- Parametric trigger definitions (rainfall levels, temperature thresholds, etc.)
- Instant claim initiation when conditions are met
- Graduated payout levels based on event severity
- No manual claims filing required from farmers
- Transparent claim evaluation logic
- Event verification through multiple data sources
- Rapid fund disbursement mechanisms
- Claim history tracking and reporting

### 4. Premium Calculation Contract

This contract dynamically adjusts insurance rates based on location, crop type, and risk factors.

**Features:**
- Risk-based pricing algorithms
- Regional risk assessment
- Crop vulnerability profiles
- Historical weather pattern consideration
- Seasonal premium adjustments
- Premium subsidization and support mechanisms
- Payment flexibility (pre-harvest, post-harvest, installments)
- Group discount calculations
- Premium reduction for risk mitigation practices
